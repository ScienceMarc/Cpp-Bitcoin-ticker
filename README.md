# C++ Bitcoin ticker
I wrote this super simple Bitcoin ticker in C++ and compiled it with visual studio.
It relies pretty heavily on system() commands so this probably wont work on OSX or Linux.
## Installation
Get repository from Github
`git clone https://github.com/ScienceMarc/Cpp-Bitcoin-ticker.git`
### Windows
`make windows`
### Linux
`make linux`
